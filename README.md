# Hangman
by Logan Becker

## What?
This is a simple hangman game.

## Who?
A student, for a high school project.

## How?
Hangman is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I used [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and compiled to browser-ready CSS using the Sass ruby gem. Otherwise, the HTML and Javascript used in this project are totally vanilla.

See the code comments in [js/javascript.js](https://github.com/Loganatha/logan-hangman/blob/master/js/javascript.js) for a full explanation of how the program works.

# Support
You're joking.
